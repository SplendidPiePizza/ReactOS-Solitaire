# ReactOS Solitaire

ReactOS Solitaire is a classic card game available for ReactOS, an open-source operating system that is binary-compatible with Windows. This version of Solitaire mimics the traditional Solitaire game found in earlier versions of Microsoft Windows, offering a similar gaming experience for users on ReactOS.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Play the traditional Klondike Solitaire with the usual deck of 52 cards.
- **Card Movement**: Drag and drop cards or use keyboard shortcuts to manage your game.
- **Scoring**: Track your score and time to see how well you're doing.
- **Win Conditions**: Win the game by sorting all cards into their respective foundation piles.
- **Card Customization**: Some versions may allow customization of card backs or themes.

## Game Rules

### Objective
The goal of Solitaire is to move all the cards to the four foundation piles (one for each suit) in ascending order, starting from Ace and ending with King.

### Setup
- **Tableau**: Seven columns of cards are laid out. The first column has one card, the second has two, and so on.
- **Stock**: The remaining cards form the "stock" pile, which you can draw from to reveal additional cards.
- **Waste**: The top card from the stock is placed here each time you draw a card.

### Gameplay
1. **Move cards**: You can move cards from the tableau to the foundation piles, or between tableau columns if the cards are in alternating colors and in descending order.
2. **Drawing from the stock**: If no moves are possible, draw cards from the stock pile. Cards in the waste pile can also be moved if they follow the correct sequence.
3. **Winning the game**: You win when all cards are placed in the foundation piles in the correct order.

### Card Movement
- **Tableau**: Cards are moved from one column to another as long as they alternate in color and are in descending order (e.g., Red 7 can go on Black 8).
- **Foundation**: Cards are moved to the foundation pile when they are in ascending order and of the same suit.

## Controls

- **Mouse**: Drag and drop cards to move them.
- **Keyboard**: Use the arrow keys for navigation, and the Enter key to confirm moves.
- **Undo**: Some versions of Solitaire may allow you to undo a move (check the game settings).
